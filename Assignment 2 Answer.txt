1. Dollar ($) Sign in Excel:
The dollar sign ($) is used in Excel to create an absolute cell reference. 
When you use an absolute cell reference, the referenced cell's row and column won't change when you copy the formula to another location. 
This is helpful when you want to lock a specific cell reference while copying formulas.

2. Changing Reference to Absolute (or Mixed):
To change a reference from relative to absolute (or mixed), you can add dollar signs to the row and/or column portion of the reference. Here's how:

To make a reference fully absolute (both row and column): $A$1
To make a reference column absolute and row relative: $A1
To make a reference row absolute and column relative: A$1

3. Order of Operations in Excel:
Excel follows the PEMDAS/BODMAS rule, 
which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, 
Multiplication and Division (left to right), 
and Addition and Subtraction (left to right). 
Formulas are evaluated following this sequence to determine the correct calculation.

4. Top 5 Functions in Excel:

SUM Function:
Syntax: =SUM(number1, number2, ...)

AVERAGE Function:
Syntax: =AVERAGE(number1, number2, ...)

IF Function:
Syntax: =IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)

VLOOKUP Function:
Syntax: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

INDEX-MATCH Function (often preferred over VLOOKUP):
Syntax: =INDEX(result_range, MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_range, [match_type]))


5. Using the SUBTOTAL Function:
The SUBTOTAL function is used to calculate various aggregate functions, such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc., on a range of data, excluding other SUBTOTAL functions within that range. It's commonly used in situations where you want to perform calculations on a filtered range of data, as it automatically considers only the visible cells after filtering.

6. Syntax of VLOOKUP Function:
The VLOOKUP function is used to search for a value in the leftmost column of a table and return a value in the same row from a specified column.
Syntax: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

lookup_value: The value to be looked up.
table_array: The range where the lookup value is located, along with the data you want to retrieve.
col_index_num: The column number in the table_array from which you want to retrieve data.
range_lookup: Optional. Enter FALSE for an exact match, TRUE (or omitted) for an approximate match.
For example, to find the price of an item with the code "A123" in a table where the codes are in column A and the prices are in column B, you could use: =VLOOKUP("A123", A1:B100, 2, FALSE)'
