1. Using AutoSum in Excel:
AutoSum is a quick way to sum up a range of numbers in Excel. To use it:

Click on the cell where you want the sum to appear.
Click the "AutoSum" button on the "Home" tab of the Ribbon.
Excel will automatically select what it thinks is the most appropriate range for the sum. You can adjust the range if needed.
Press "Enter" to confirm and calculate the sum.

When to Use AutoSum:
AutoSum is best used when you need to quickly calculate the sum of a contiguous range of cells. It's especially useful for columns or rows of numbers where you don't need advanced functions.

2. Shortcut Key for AutoSum:
The shortcut key to perform AutoSum is Alt + =. Pressing these keys together will automatically insert the SUM function with a suggested range.

3. Getting Rid of Formulas that Omit Adjacent Cells:
If a formula is omitting adjacent cells that you want it to include, you can adjust the formula's range:

Double-click on the cell containing the formula to enter edit mode.
Modify the range of the formula to include the missing cells.
Press "Enter" to update the formula and its result.

4. Selecting Non-Adjacent Cells in Excel 2016:
To select non-adjacent cells in Excel 2016:

Click on the first cell you want to select.
Hold down the Ctrl key (Command key on Mac).
While holding Ctrl, click on the other cells you want to select.

5. Effect of Alt + Pressing Letters OCW:
Holding down the Alt key and pressing the letters "OCW" in quick succession is a keyboard shortcut to hide the Ribbon in Excel. It's a way to maximize the available space on your screen by temporarily hiding the Ribbon, which contains the various tabs and commands.

6. Inserting a Row After Right-Clicking on a Row Reference:
If you right-click on a row reference number (the number on the left side of the worksheet) and then click "Insert," the new row will be added above the row you right-clicked on. This action shifts the existing rows downward to make space for the newly inserted row.
